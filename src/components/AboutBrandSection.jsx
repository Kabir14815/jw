          Fusing the royal hues of golden and sage, the logo design portrays the elegance and persevering quality of the brand. The letters “T”, “H,” and “G” meet in perfect artistic proportions to bring forth a striking visual harmony. The "T" takes the form of a handleless dagger, piercing boldly through the center of the "H," symbolizing strength and precision. Meanwhile, the "G" gracefully encircles the "H," its curves weaving a sense of unity and timelessness of The House of Garg. Together, these elements craft a logo that displays both royal sophistication and the strong legacy, capturing the essence of “The House of Garg” brand with dynamic flair.
